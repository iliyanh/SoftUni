       It is known that:

       · The set decoration for the movie costs 10% of the budget.

       · For more than 150 background actors, there is a 10% discount on the costumes.

       Input

       The function receives 3 arguments:

       Film budget - a real number in the range [1.00 … 1000000.00]

       Number of background actors - an integer in the range [1 … 500]

       Price for costume per actor - a real number in the range [1.00 … 1000.00]

       o "Action!"

       o "Wingard starts filming with {remaining money} leva left."

       The result should be formatted to the second decimal place.  => [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/Conditional%20Statements%20-%20Exercise/godzillavskong.js)

   
   6. **Problem 6** : Ivan decides to improve the World record in long-distance swimming. The function receives: the current record in seconds that Ivan needs to beat, the distance in meters he needs to swim, and the time in seconds it takes him to swim a distance of 1 meter. Write a function that calculates whether he has succeeded, considering that water resistance slows him down by 12.5 seconds for every 15 meters. When calculating how many times Ivan will be slowed down due to water resistance, the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

       Calculate the time in seconds for which Ivan will swim the distance and the difference compared to the World record.

       Input:

       The function receives 3 arguments:

       The current record in seconds - a real number in the range [0.00 … 100000.00]
       The distance in meters - a real number in the range [0.00 … 100000.00]
       The time in seconds it takes to swim a distance of 1 meter - a real number in the range [0.00 … 1000.00]
       Output:

       The console output depends on the result:

       If Ivan beats the World record (his time is less than the record), print:
       "Yes, he succeeded! The new world record is {Ivan's time} seconds."

       If he doesn't beat the record (his time is greater than or equal to the record), print:
       "No, he failed! He was {seconds slower} seconds slower."

       The result should be formatted to two decimal places. => [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/Conditional%20Statements%20-%20Exercise/WorldSwimmingRecord.js)
