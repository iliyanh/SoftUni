### JavaScript Basics

 - **Lesson 1: First Steps In Coding - Lab**

   
    In this lab, we'll cover the following problems:
   
   1. Problem 1 : Write a function that prints the text "Hello SoftUni" in English.  =>  [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/First%20Steps%20In%20Coding%20-%20Lab/Hello.js)
  
   
   2. Problem 2 : Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 on separate lines in the console.  => [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/First%20Steps%20In%20Coding%20-%20Lab/printNumbers1to10.js)
  
   
   3. Problem 3 : Write a function that takes an integer as input, calculates the area of a square with the given side length, and returns the result.  => [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/First%20Steps%20In%20Coding%20-%20Lab/squareArea.js)
  
   
   4. Problem 4 : Write a function that reads a real number from the console and converts it from inches to centimeters. To do this, multiply the inches by 2.54 (1 inch = 2.54 centimeters).  => [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/First%20Steps%20In%20Coding%20-%20Lab/convertinctosm.js)
  
   
   5. Problem 5 : Write a function that takes a person's name as input and prints "Hello, <name>!", where <name> is the input name from the console.  => [Solution](https://github.com/iliyanh/SoftUni/blob/main/JS%20Basics/First%20Steps%20In%20Coding%20-%20Lab/greetings.js)

   
   6. Problem 6 : Write a function that takes: first name, last name, age, and city as inputs, and prints a message in the following format:
